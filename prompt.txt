This Git error occurs when you're trying to push to a branch that hasn't been linked to a remote branch yet. Here's how to fix it:

Run the suggested command to set up the upstream branch:

bash

Copy
git push --set-upstream origin main
Or you can use the shorter -u flag:

bash

Copy
git push -u origin main
This command does two things:

Pushes your local main branch to the remote repository
Sets up tracking between your local main branch and the remote main branch
After running this command once, you can use simple git push in the future for this branch.


git remote add origin https://github.com/ThreadDotRun/Identificator.git
